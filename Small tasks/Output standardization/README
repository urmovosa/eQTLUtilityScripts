Script for standardizing the QTL mapping pipeline meta-analysis result files. It achieves three tasks:

It standardizes/changes all cohort names in the output file

It enables to change cohort ordering in the file

It enables to remove some per-cohort summary statistics from the file. NB! Results of the meta-analysis will still be based on all the cohorts in the original meta-analysis.

Three mandatory arguments:

--mapping_file  File with fixing information. Tab-delimited file with three columns:

        - name_old- cohort name in the original eQTL file.
        
        - name_new- cohort name in the fixed eQTL file.
        
        - add_to_file- whether or not to add respective cohort to the output file (yes/no)

--orig_file Original file form eQTLMapping meta-analysis output. Can be gzipped or unzipped.

--fixed_file  Fixed file where cohort order and naming is updated. No file extensions needed and the file will be gzipped.

Optional argument:

-h help
