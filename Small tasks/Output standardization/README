Script for standardizing the QTL mapping pipeline meta-analysis result files. It achieves three tasks:

1. It standardizes/changes all cohort names in the output file.

2. It enables to change cohort ordering in the file.

3. It enables to remove some per-cohort summary statistics from the file. NB! Meta-analyzed summary statistics will still be based on all the cohorts in the original meta-analysis!

4. It enables to remove cohort-specific information (cohort names, Z-scores and sample sizes). Instead report the number of cohorts and number of samples where QTL was tested.

Three mandatory arguments:

--mapping_file  File with fixing information. Tab-delimited file with three columns:

        name_old- cohort name in the original eQTL file.
        
        name_new- cohort name in the fixed eQTL file.
        
        add_to_file- whether or not to add respective cohort to the output file (yes/no).

--orig_file Original file form eQTLMapping meta-analysis output. Can be gzipped or unzipped.

--fixed_file  Fixed file where cohort order and naming is updated. No file extensions needed and the file will be gzipped.

Optional arguments:

--remove_cohort_specific_information If this flag is added, cohort-specific information is removed from the output file.

-h help

Basic usage:

--remove_cohort_specific_information If this flag is added, cohort-specific information is removed from the input file.
